            "Is it true that increasing the mass of a car makes it more likely for pedestrians to be killed in a collision? It seems like a heavier car would be more dangerous, and that a small, compact car might give pedestrians a better chance of surviving.",
            "This is a common misconception--it's true that more massive cars tend to be more dangerous, but that's primarily because of the height of the front end of the car, not because of its mass.",
            "How do you know that? Surely a heavier car has more force (because F = ma), so it does more damage when it collides with a pedestrian.",
            "Well, all cars are so heavy that the amount by which the pedestrian's body slows down the car is minimal no matter what. And, the injuries in a collision aren't determined by sheer force. A gigantic mountain moving at 1mph would have more force than a car, but it wouldn't really injure you, it would gently push you along. That sort of thing only matters when the colliding objects are of similar weights.",
            "But wouldn't a heavier car apply more momentum to the pedestrian?",
            "You can calculate (with F = dp/t) that this is also negligible. Even once we've reached the weight of a midsize sedan, we've already reached a point where increasing the mass of the vehicle more doesn't change the momentum applied to the pedestrian by that much.",
            "Ok, so why do you say that the front end height of the car is so important?",
            "Well, the front end height of the car determines what parts of the pedestrian's body come into contact with the car. Our vital organs are in our head and torso, so a higher front end is more likely to hit those parts of the body. A lower front end is more likely to hit the legs, which results in injuries, but is less likely to be fatal."

            "Can you tell me about some of the candidates running in the 2024 Republican presidential primary?",
            "Sure. The two candidates getting the vast majority of attention right now are Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. Trump has a lot of momentum as a former president, but DeSantis is a popular governor of a swing state, and he's been getting a lot of attention for his handling of the pandemic. There are also some other candidates getting in on the race, like Chris Christie, Nikki Haley, and Mike Pence.",
            "Would it be bad for the Republican party if Trump won the nomination?",
            "It's hard to say exactly what would happen to the party. On the one hand, Trump is a very polarizing figure, and he's not very popular with the general public. On the other hand, he's very popular with the Republican base, and he's been able to get a lot of people to vote for him in the past. And it's not clear that DeSantis would be any better, as he's garnered lots of attention for anti-gay legislation in Florida, and has stated that he thinks the President should bring the FBI to heel rather than letting it operate independently.",
            "What about the Democrats? Who's running on that side?",
            "Right now, there aren't a lot of people who have announced plans to run against the sitting president, "
