This project is an implementation of a conversational AI model. The main files in the project are:

- `data.py`: This file is responsible for processing and tokenizing the datasets used for training and evaluation. It includes functions for handling different types of datasets and preparing them for use in the model.

- `train.py`: This file contains the main training loop for the model. It sets up the model, optimizer, and learning rate scheduler, and then trains the model over a specified number of epochs.

- `chat.py`: This file sets up a chat interface for interacting with the trained model. It includes functions for generating responses from the model based on user input.
